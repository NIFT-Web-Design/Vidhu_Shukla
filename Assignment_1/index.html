      <h2>Flexibility with Timing, Budget, and Location</h2>
      <p>We have a number of consultants available on a full-time basis, however, we know that full-time consultants aren’t always the right choice for an organization’s project or budget. That’s why we always strive to be flexible and accommodating. Below are a few of the ways that we can meet your specific needs.</p>


<div class="setinOne">
  <div class="consultantopp">
    <h3>part-time consultants</h3>
    <p>Not all positions need to be full-time. You may find that you need someone with a highly specific skill set to work on a project only part-time. We can always find the right consultants to fit your specific requirements.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="consultantopp">
    <h3>advice on retainer</h3>
    <p>At times you just need a little impartial advice here and there, without the investment in a full-time consultant. We can put you in contact with the right person to answer your questions on an as-needed basis.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="consultantopp">
    <h3>remote consultants</h3>
    <p>When you need the job done right but don’t require a person in the office, we can find the right consultant at a lower cost if they work remotely.</p>
  </div>

  </div>

<div class="setintwo">
  <div class="consultantopp">
    <h3>short-term contracts</h3>
    <p>Not every placement needs to be a 2 year contract. We recognize that many projects will require short-term work, and we are more than willing to collaborate with you to ensure the most flexible arrangement to fit your institution’s specific needs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="consultantopp">
    <h3>cost-flexible solutions</h3>
    <p>Whether you’d like to commit to an hourly contract or fixed-fee pricing, we offer a variety of options that allow you to meet your budget requirements. For example, in some cases, a junior consultant may be exactly what you need.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="consultantopp">
    <h3>custom project solutions</h3>
    <p>If you don’t see one solution that works for you, we are more than happy to work to fit your needs and create a fair arrangement that works for you—whether that means modifying an existing service, combining services, or having a consultant work on a trial-basis.</p>

              <h9>"STRATEGISTS AND ADVISORS"</h9>
              <p>A successful project requires a sturdy foundation
                 upon which everything else is built. We can provide
                  talented Higher Ed administration and IT strategists
                   with the experience to systematically improve your
                    strategy, operations, and technology <span> to provide
                     the best value and experience for your stakeholders.</span>

                <h9>"FUNCTIONAL CONSULTANTS"</h9>
                <p>Not every project requires every type of consulting,
                   but most require some form of requirements gathering
                   and analysis. From business analysts to project managers,
                <span>we are sure we have the right fit for any functional
                     IT consultant position.</span>
                </p>
              </article>
                <article>
                  <h9>"TECHNICAL CONSULTANTS"</h9>
                <p>When a project requires technical consultants who
                   exceed expectations, we have you covered. From server
                    administrators to network engineers and developers,
                    we have the right fit for your specific needs,<span> no matter
                    how niche those requirements may be.</span>
